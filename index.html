            <h2>NARUTO</h2>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails
               on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, 
               Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, 
               through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the
               world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
               He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's 
               Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

            <h2>LUFFY</h2>
            <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece.
               He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. He desires
               to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would help facilitate an
               unknown dream of his that he has told only to his brothers and crew. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most 
               freedom in the world.Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. Thanks to his strong imagination,
               Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of his Devil Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his 
               own rubbery body into a variety of powerful forms.</p>

            <h2>ICHIGO</h2>
            <p>Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and 
               older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his
               spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes.
               He likes to wear slim fitting clothes. He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.
               Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the 
               standard Shinigami shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but 
               it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers. It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.</p>
